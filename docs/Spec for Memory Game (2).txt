Software Requirements for Memory Game
Memory Game
Author: Miriam Malka Gross


Overview:
This document outlines in detail the software requirements for developing the game of Memory, as well as the rules of the game and UI setup.




The Game:
The user will be presented with a form containing 20 cards appearing blank. Each card has a matching picture to another card on the board. Upon each turn, the player clicks on 2 cards he thinks match. Once they are clicked, their pictures will show. If their pictures match, the cards are removed from the board and that player gets a point. If their pictures do not match, then at the end of the turn, those cards are turned over and their pictures are hidden from view. After all the matches are found, the player who found the most matches wins the game. If both players find the same number of matches at the end of the game, then it is a tie.


Software Implementation
UI elements
* Form, which will include:
   * A 4 x 5 grid of buttons representing the cards
   * Top toolbar with 3 cells
      * Start button
      * 2 player option radio button
      * Play against the computer option radio button
   * Under the top toolbar, another toolbar with 4 cells
      * Label with message to player
      * label with game status
      * Textbox with score player 1
      * Textbox with score player 2
   * The game should be colorful, and the colors chosen are left to be chosen by the developer


Player modes:
There are two modes: A) 2 player B) play against computer


* 2 Player: 
   * 2 people play against each other. Each player assumes a role as player 1 and player 2, respectively, and they each play upon their turn.


* Play Against The Computer: 
   * The user is player 1 and the computer is automatically assigned player 2. The user chooses 2 buttons upon his turn and the computer chooses 2 buttons upon his turn based on a Random.


Game Process and Rules:
* Upon opening the game, all the cards,which are in the form of buttons, are disabled. The game status label says “Click start to begin game.” Once you click the “Start” button, the cards become enabled and the game status label says “Player 1 turn.” The message to player label remains blank until player 1 chooses his second card.
* The 2 player option is automatically checked by default and the textboxes with the scores have a read-only property.
* Player 1 clicks on 2 cards. If their pictures match, then the cards disappear from the board and a point is added to his score, and the message to player label says “Match.” If the pictures do not match, the cards are then “turned over,” as in their pictures disappear and the cards stay on the board, and the message to player label says “Nice try.” 
* After Player 1 finishes choosing his second card, the game status label says “Player 2 turn”. Upon choosing his first card, the message to player label becomes blank until Player 2 chooses a second card and the result of his turn is known. The process of choosing cards and getting points described in the previous bullet point is repeated. If Player 2 is another user, then, the user takes his turn just as Player 1 did. If player 2 is the computer, it will choose 2 cards at random. The message to player label will work the same way it worked for Player 1. After player 2 chooses his card, the game status label will say “Player 1 turn” and the message to player label will become blank when Player 1 chooses his first card.
* The user that finds the most matches wins. If both users find an equal number of matches, then it is a tie. The game status label says the status at the end of the game, who the winner is, or tie, based on the result. If player 1 wins, the form should turn blue, if player 2 wins, the form should turn red, and if it is a tie, the form should turn purple.
* To restart the game, press “Start.”
