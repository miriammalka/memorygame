Software Requirements for Memory Game
Memory Game
Author: Miriam Malka Gross


Overview:
This document outlines in detail the software requirements for developing the game of Memory, as well as the rules of the game and UI setup.




The Game:
The user will be presented with a form containing 20 cards appearing blank. Each card has a matching picture to another card on the board. Upon each turn, the player clicks on 2 cards he thinks match. Once they are clicked, their pictures will show. If their pictures match, the cards are removed from the board and that player gets a point. If their pictures do not match, then at the end of the turn, those cards are turned over and their pictures are hidden from view. After all the matches are found, the player who found the most matches wins the game. If both players find the same number of matches at the end of the game, then it is a tie.


Software Implementation
UI elements
* Form, which will include:
   * A 4 x 5 grid of buttons representing the cards
   * Top toolbar with 3 cells
      * Start button
      * Label for the game status
      * Label for the message
   * Under the top toolbar, another toolbar with 4 cells
      * Label for score player 1
      * Label for score player 2
      * Next turn button
   * The game should be colorful, and the colors chosen are left to be chosen by the developer


Game Process and Rules:
* Upon opening the game, all the cards,which are in the form of buttons and appear blank, are disabled. The game status label says “Click start to begin game.” Once you click the “Start” button, the cards become enabled and the game status label says “Player1 turn.” The Message label remains blank until Player 1 chooses his second card.
* Player 1 clicks on 2 cards, and their pictures appear. If their pictures match, a point is added to his score, and the Message label says “Match.” Then the cards disappear from the board once the Next Turn button is clicked and the Game Status label says “Player2” and the Message label becomes blank. If the pictures do not match, the Message label says “Nice try.” Once the Next Turn button is clicked, the cards are then “turned over,” as in their pictures disappear and the cards stay on the board, the Game Status label says “Player2”, and the Message label becomes blank. 
* The process of choosing cards and getting points described in the previous bullet point is repeated for Player 2.
* The user that finds the most matches wins. If both users find an equal number of matches, then it is a tie. The game status label says the status at the end of the game, who the winner is, or tie, based on the result. 
* To restart the game, press “Start.”
