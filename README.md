# Memory Game

## Overview ##
This document outlines in detail the software requirements for developing the game of Memory, as well as the rules of the game and UI setup.

## The game ##
The user will be presented with a form containing 20 cards appearing blank. Each card has a matching picture to another card on the board. Upon each turn, the player clicks on 2 cards he thinks match. Once they are clicked, their pictures will show. If their pictures match, the cards are removed from the board and that player gets a point. If their pictures do not match, then at the end of the turn, those cards are turned over and their pictures are hidden from view. After all the matches are found, the player who found the most matches wins the game. If both players find the same number of matches at the end of the game, then it is a tie.

**The full spec of the game is in the repo**
